## Getting Started

The Momentum Design team has made optimizations with this Sketch Library so you can more efficiently create Cisco Webex interfaces. In the instructions below, we’ll cover the basics and some tips for you to get started.

Sketch Libraries allow you to have Momentum Design components and patterns available from Sketch’s symbols menu in any file you open. Sketch Libraries will automatically update your designs when the library is updated. Your designs will never be out of date if they’re linked to this Sketch Library document.

### How to link the Momentum Design Sketch UI Kits as Sketch Libraries

1) Copy and paste the following link in any browser. This will subscribe your Sketch application to automatically download and install new versions of the Momentum Design System Sketch UI Kit.

* **Web Library**:
<br />`sketch://add-library?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdownloads.momentum-ui.com%2Fui-kits%2Fmomentum-ui-web-sketch-rss.xml`

<br />

2)  Your browser may ask you if you want to open Sketch. Select **Open Sketch**.

3) Sketch will open and automatically open Preferences and take you to the Libraries tab. Your chosen library will take a moment to sync will then be completely ready to use.

Alternatively, download the Sketch Library in this repository you'd like to install. Open `Sketch > Preferences > Libraries` and click `Add Library...`. Select the library you'd like to install.

Verify that you've successfully installed the Sketch Library by opening `Sketch > Preferences > Libraries`. You should see all of the libraries you installed above.

<br />
Throughout a release, Momentum's design team contributes to these Sketch files through an application called <a href="https://www.abstract.com/" target="_blank" title="Abstract">Abstract</a>. Public contributions become unmanageable to merge since they are added to a version that is out of date.
